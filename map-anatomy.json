An eighteenth-century map required a printer, engraver, surveyors, a cartographer, and a colorist who were using mathematics, art, older maps and symbols, previous atlases, and written accounts of travel."

This image tells us something about the message the mapmaker is trying to communicate. For instance, the deer grazing in front of farmland surrounded by a forested border characterizes the US as a land of ample resources."

The largest map here shows the states and territories of the US in 1839. But surrounding the map on all sides are inset maps (often just called insets). Insets show information at a different resolution than the largest map. For instance, this map includes more detailed maps of individual cities like Philadelphia, of regions like the “environs of Boston, and of large areas like “Oregon and Mandan Districts.” Notice how there is even an inset in this last inset!"
