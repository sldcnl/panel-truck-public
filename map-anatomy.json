An eighteenth-century map required a printer, engraver, surveyors, a cartographer, and a colorist who were using mathematics, art, older maps and symbols, previous atlases, and written accounts of travel."

It usually appears in the biggest lettering and often in a decorative space on the map called a cartouche. “United States of America” may seem like too broad a name for this map, but remember, in 1839 there were no official states west of Missouri, Arkansas, and Louisiana."
