An eighteenth-century map required a printer, engraver, surveyors, a cartographer, and a colorist who were using mathematics, art, older maps and symbols, previous atlases, and written accounts of travel."

It usually appears in the biggest lettering and often in a decorative space on the map called a cartouche. “United States of America” may seem like too broad a name for this map, but remember, in 1839 there were no official states west of Missouri, Arkansas, and Louisiana."

This image tells us something about the message the mapmaker is trying to communicate. For instance, the deer grazing in front of farmland surrounded by a forested border characterizes the US as a land of ample resources."
